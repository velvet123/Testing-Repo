= Print, PDF, Email Privacy & Data =

PDFs are generated on our server; **this plugin “phones home”**.  Also if the end-user shares the page via email, the email is sent by our server.

Our Fundamental Principles:

* **We do not sell data.** Period.
* **We do not share data,** unless compelled by the law.
* **We do not ask for personal information,** unless it's needed to provide a service.
* **We don’t store personal information,**  unless required for the on-going operation of service.

Specifically, here’s what we do with the data and information:

**Page content is not sent or stored on server,** except to generate the PDF. After the PDF is generated, we temporarily store the PDF to allow the end-user time to download. After this time has expired, the PDF is permanently deleted.

If you’re using the non-JavaScript option in the plugin, then the preview is generated on our server and temporarily stored in cache for a few minutes. After that time it is permanently deleted.

**Email Address & Content get permanently deleted** In order to send the email, we need to store the email address and message on our server. After the email has been sent and found not to be a spammer, the email address is permanently deleted.

**Server log files get created and deleted.** Browsers and Servers pass non-personally-identifying information, such as the browser type, language, referrer, and the date/time. We may use this data to analyze how the service is being used. Non-personally-identifying aggregate data may get published, e.g., by a report on trends in the usage of the service.
